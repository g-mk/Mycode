         <h2>E-Voting</h2>
         <p>
            Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting using electronic 
            means to either aid or take care of the chores of casting and 
            counting votes. Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting
            may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic data 
            transmission to full-function online voting through common 
            connectable household devices. Similarly, the degree of automation 
            may vary from simple chores to a complete solution that includes 
            voter registration &amp; authentication, vote input, local or 
            precinct tallying, vote data encryption and transmission to servers,
            vote consolidation and tabulation, and election administration. A 
            worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while 
            complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, 
            and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong 
            requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, 
            swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness,
            scalability and ecological sustainability.

         <h2>The Importance of Protecting Our Right to Vote</h2>
         <p>
            Half a century ago the Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought an end to 
            the era of Jim Crow by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of 
            race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. One year later the 
            landmark legislation was strengthened and expanded when the Voting 
            Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law on Aug. 6, 1965. The Voting 
            Rights Act prohibited discrimination in voting and, together with 
            the Civil Rights Act, enshrines the principles upon which our nation
            was founded. These laws serve as a testament to all who sacrificed 
            to work toward ending segregation and discrimination.
         </p>
         <p>
            For nearly half a century the Voting Rights Act has stood as a 
            central pillar in the protection of fair voting practices. Our 
            nation now faces the greatest threat to voting rights since 
            Reconstruction.
         </p>
         <p>
            Last year the Supreme Court issued its decision in Shelby County v. 
            Holder. The decision severely undermines the effectiveness of the 
            Voting Rights Act. Although legislation has been introduced in the
            House of Representatives to address this flawed decision, Congress 
            has yet to take action. Shelby County has allowed more than a dozen
            states with histories of voter discrimination to implement new 
            restrictions on voting.
         </p>
         <p>
            When it comes time for voting, voter suppression is far too 
            prevalent throughout our country. We need not look further than our 
            own state of Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott has made repeated 
            attempts to purge the voter database, despite the fact that his 
            attempt to do so in 2011 was suspended by the U.S. Department of 
            Justice. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled 
            just last month that Gov. Scott’s administration violated federal 
            law when he tried to purge non-citizens from the voter rolls 
            immediately prior to the 2012 presidential election.
         </p>
         <p>
            Today we face an unsettling reality. Shelby County, one of many 
            recent decisions by the Supreme Court that has disenfranchised 
            American voters, made it easier for minorities to be discriminated 
            against at the polls. Republicans in Congress, as well as in states 
            across the country, have gone out of their way to make it more 
            difficult for minorities, the elderly, and young people to vote. 
            This is outrageous and should serve as a wake-up call to voters 
            everywhere.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our nation has the obligation to make it easier, not more difficult,
            for all American to vote. Instead of creating burdensome photo-ID 
            requirements for voting, we should be expanding access to the polls 
            through early voting and same-day registration. Instead of finding 
            new ways to limit voting, we should be working day and night to 
            ensure that every American has the opportunity to vote in person 
            or through absentee ballot.
         </p>
         <p>
            Voter discrimination has not disappeared, and Congress must act to 
            put in place greater voter protections to ensure that all Americans 
            can have their voices heard. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the 
            Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014, which will take the necessary 
            steps to address the flawed decision in Shelby County. I hope that 
            Congress takes up this legislation very soon, because we cannot 
            afford to let this issue slip from focus. Countless individuals have
            fought long and hard for the chance to vote on Election Day, and we 
            must not allow the clock to turn back on decades of progress.
         </p>
